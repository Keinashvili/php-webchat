# PHP Realtime chat web application
This is my version of PHP Realtime web chat application.

It is based on my own MVC pattern which you can also find on my github profile. 

P.S. The design isn't mine. I took it from youtube tutorial.

NOTE: This is just for educational purposes and hasn't been tested on production!

## Project setup
### Go to directory and run composer install
```
composer install
```
### After that go to public directory and run server
```
cd public
```
```
php -S localhost:8080
```
or on any port you want.

### Connect to Database.
You need to open config.php file and configure database properties.
After you connect there will be documentation how to use pattern.
## I hope u will like it!
